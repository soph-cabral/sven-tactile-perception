## Overview

SVEN is a research project that explores how computer vision systems can evolve beyond simple object recognition to understand the textural and material qualities that define human sensory experience.

## The Problem

Current computer vision systems excel at identifying and classifying objects but fail to perceive the material properties that humans intuitively understand. A child can recognize ice cream not just by its shape, but by understanding its material qualitiesâ€”the surface that promises coldness and creaminess. This research addresses the fundamental gap between machine object detection and human multisensory perception.

## Our Approach

SVEN redefines both the inputs and outputs of machine vision:

- **Inputs**: Finer-scale visual details and motion that mirror human texture perception
- **Outputs**: Rich artifacts like texture maps and simulations instead of simple text descriptions

Using a microscopic imaging system built around a small field microscope, SVEN captures surface landscapes invisible to the naked eye and translates them into "machine touch" descriptions.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”¬ **Microscopic Texture Capture**
- Systematic surface scanning at microscopic resolution
- Programmable motion control for consistent data collection
- Mobile device integration for real-time adjustments

### ðŸ§  **Three Analytical Workflows**

1. **Spatial Texture Mapping**: Maps environments through tactile qualities rather than object identification
2. **Machine Tactile Visual Generation**: Reimagines objects through generated textures from edge maps
3. **Temporal Texture Dynamics**: Captures how materials change over time and space

### ðŸ“Š **Novel Perception Metrics**
- **Edge Density**: Quantifies visual texture complexity
- **Grain Continuity**: Measures surface pattern consistency
- **Temporal Texture Evolution**: Tracks material changes across time

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV 4.0+
- Microscope hardware (or sample datasets)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sven-computer-vision.git
cd sven-computer-vision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from sven import TextureAnalyzer, SpatialMapper

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TextureAnalyzer()

# Process surface image
texture_map = analyzer.analyze_surface("path/to/surface_image.jpg")

# Generate spatial mapping
mapper = SpatialMapper()
environment_map = mapper.create_texture_map(texture_map)
```

## Results & Findings

- **Textural Identity Discovery**: Different environments possess unique textural signatures
- **Indoor/Outdoor Clustering**: Distinct patterns in color variation vs. hue relationships
- **Spatial Texture Mapping**: Successfully created maps based on tactile qualities rather than object placement

## Research Applications

- **Material Science**: Understanding surface properties through visual analysis
- **Robotics**: Enhanced tactile feedback for manipulation tasks
- **Architecture**: Designing spaces based on textural experience
- **Accessibility**: Creating tactile descriptions for visually impaired users
- **Digital Art**: Generating texture-based creative content
